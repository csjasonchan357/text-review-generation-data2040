I'm a size 5 foot and these boots are perfect for me. I have several pairs of boots, but these are no longer in use, so I'm hesitant to buy out of fear they won't last long. I got a pair of Merrell boots in the past that looked great but were still no better than Merrell boots. The Merrells had an upper with less padding (i.e. not added) and the boots were so comfortable that I decided to buy them in a shoe that I can stretch and put them on. As I had them in a dark room, with no light or warmth, and with no ventilation, I had an even more uncomfortable boot for the cold, rough terrain. My feet were freezing on the hot days that I walked, so I decided to walk in them, so I went to see it in the garage, and the leather was a tough leather, and I rubbed bare and it looked pretty good. It was comfortable to wear on wet ground, but the boots didn't look like much and they felt to me more like the boots I tried out in the garage. So, I had to go to a friend's store and get them, and I had no luck, and now these boots are worn out, at least for now. The leather was great, and they were comfortable. My boots seem to be working fine; it looks like they are being fitted to my feet perfectly and, I believe, they are working, but I am worried that this will be another \"cold\" boot, and I still need more to be able to make them run. I have these boots, and while they look great in all areas, I can only use them in areas that are colder than the ones I'm wearing. Also, if any of this is the case, if Merrell gets replaced with other boot brands, or if the brand I bought is discontinued, I can't imagine them being better.<|endoftext|>\n","<|startoftext|>~`5-0~^a-lot daughter~@I like them so much, I bought a second pair after the first one of these for a much larger price.

I wore it to a New Year's Celebration event. It went with me everywhere and felt like I wore my wedding shoes to a night of dance and dancing. I couldn't feel the toes in either hand with normal wear and tear. I wore gloves when going through the bar with the ladies. Not sure they made the difference in how it fit me, but for the price, it was pretty comfortable and I'm pretty sure they got it for me.<|endoftext|>\n","<|startoftext|>~`4-0~^a-good-price good~@A good shoe fit. The shoe comes up a lot (1/2 size smaller). My feet aren't quite that sore as a day on the boat. I've tried running on other laces but the toe box is rather big and snug. I've worn them a few times now. The sole is more padded than expected as well. The sole is more water resistant than expected and seems to be comfortable enough.<|endoftext|>\n","<|startoftext|>~`11-0~^fit~@These are my second pair of the Dickies Wide in wide. This time they fit perfect, i just wish i could buy another pair and buy a couple more. They are well constructed and look good. They are the same size, they have just been ironed a little. A lot easier than trying to iron them out and get them to stretch than trying to iron them the whole time. I will update as needed. They definitely do a better job in the dryer than the regular ones but it can be a long day!<|endoftext|>\n","<|startoftext|>~`4-0~^~@I really like these sandals! They have a very comfortable arch support, which I'm not used to due to my foot not being wide enough. They are comfortable to walk in and are warm for my winter sports. They have a comfortable fit, too, but if you have average width feet, these may not do as good a job. It's not like walking in rain, but these sandals are made to withstand even the most common foot pain. And, the leather sole is a soft, comfortable sandal that stretches out to you in a matter of minutes. I like my shoes as I have a wide variety of sizes as well as a wide variety of colors. My feet were so wide I could barely see through them! I am very happy with these sandals and would highly recommend them!<|endoftext|>\n","<|startoftext|>~`5-0~^a-pair fit~@These shoes fit a bit baggy. After a couple of washings with them, they are as baggy as the picture shows. Overall i am impressed with them.<|endoftext|>\n","<|startoftext|>~`5-0~^~@I have only purchased these on the basis of my experiences with my new shoes at work on this year's model. I have been very pleased by them. They feel like they were manufactured with very high quality, and the sizing was perfect! They appear to be really comfortable even when I do not work with heavy socks.<|endoftext|>\n","<|startoftext|>~`5-0~^~@This is the best thing I've ever bought, and I have always had a pair, just made easier to get on and off. Easy to use, comfortable, and the only thing I would have to get off is of course the front zipper, because I have a pair that comes fitted to the right knee so I didn't have to remove the front zipper and just get it in a different position.<|endoftext|>\n","<|startoftext|>~`1-0~^~@This set is absolutely garbage! It wasn't made to last or fit into a normal 9/11, the sole is so soft and stiff the leather is very short (the first time I wore it, my foot was already over a week old, which was painful). The first thing that happened was when you put the boot on the wrong side, the rubber was rubbing my right foot. Then the top snap on right, and was starting to hurt. I returned it as I felt the straps had gotten too tight even though I still wore boots, even after they were broken. It's not to mention the stitching on the left shoe is so stiff it's rubbing the bottom of my foot where it feels like it has been broken. I was so happy I didn't have to give it a try, I wear them everyday so I never had to buy another pair out. But, they seem to be a bit baggy, I can't give them 3 stars for comfort or style, I had to send them back.<|endoftext|>\n","<|startoftext\n","\n","[910 | 30.75] loss=1.43 avg=1.43\n","[920 | 43.19] loss=1.58 avg=1.51\n","[930 | 55.62] loss=1.50 avg=1.50\n","[940 | 68.06] loss=1.31 avg=1.45\n","[950 | 80.52] loss=1.49 avg=1.46\n","[960 | 92.94] loss=1.44 avg=1.46\n","[970 | 105.37] loss=1.55 avg=1.47\n","[980 | 117.82] loss=1.32 avg=1.45\n","[990 | 130.24] loss=1.42 avg=1.45\n","[1000 | 142.67] loss=1.76 avg=1.48\n","Saving checkpoint/run1/model-1000\n","Training on /content/drive/My Drive/text-review-generation-data2040/data/chunks/Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_encoded_mini10.txt...\n","Loading checkpoint checkpoint/run1/model-1000\n","INFO:tensorflow:Restoring parameters from checkpoint/run1/model-1000\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["\r  0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]"],"name":"stderr"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["Loading dataset...\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["100%|██████████| 1/1 [00:23<00:00, 23.21s/it]\n"],"name":"stderr"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["dataset has 6291711 tokens\n","Training...\n","Saving checkpoint/run1/model-1000\n","Saving checkpoint/run1/model-1000\n","======== SAMPLE 1 ========\n","<|startoftext|>~`5-0~^~@i had to have a size 12, so i had a size 8, so i've made these jeans. i've had many pairs of these same jeans and they are still available at most amazon<|endoftext|>\n","<|startoftext|>~`5-0~^~@i have a size 12, so i had a size 8, so i've made these jeans. i've had many pairs of these same jeans and they are still available at most amazon<|endoftext|>\n","<|startoftext|>~`4-0~^~@Great shoes for the money.<|endoftext|>\n","<|startoftext|>~`5-0~^~@it is so comfy. i love how comfortable it is. i love its design and the sizing on these is spot on. i would recommend buying it a size up from other reviewers on here<|endoftext|>\n","<|startoftext|>~`5-0~^nice~@Nice<|endoftext|>\n","<|startoftext|>~`5-0~^this-shirt~@This shirt is super fun and nice and warm.

I have about 10-12 pairs of boots with these boots and love that because the look and feel are so comfortable these boots are also easier to put on and take off. I have to wear them a bit at times to put them on and they feel great! The boots really do take a little getting used to. Even after many months on the ice I love my boots so much that I need to go back to the original pair. The look and feel is great. They are so pretty and are also super cute. The last year and two years of winter/spring winters has caused this boot to be almost completely cold, because they are really hard to get on and off. It has lasted months with no break in. Even though it has been completely cold I still keep my boots in the snow when I go out, because it keeps my feet warm during the winter. The sole is very soft and gives some protection of the ice. I highly recommend these boots to anyone out there and in general, anyone that has high arches will want to buy these boots. I get so many compliments on them. I hope they will hold up to many years of wear. I think I'll be able to wear them for years of wearing them out. They last a lot more then any other boot I've purchased in my life, and I've worn all of them out in a week at the office, and still love my boots. They definitely will be around for a few more years.<|endoftext|>\n","<|startoftext|>~`5-0~^~@I've always loved these sandals. Since I got them, they have become my go to sandals!

I have tried other tennis shoes as well (for tennis) and to this point, they have been my most comfortable purchase and they are also much more breathable than any other tennis shoes I have ever had. It took me a lot of research to learn how these shoes feel. I think that these may be my favorite tennis shoe, if that is what you're looking for. I bought them and now they just don't wear out, and I can definitely say that these shoes are very good looking, great fit (the top part where the toes meet just feels a bit weird, even for someone that has \"wide\" feet) and are extremely stylish! If my review does not do them justice, I might add that the fabric is really nice at the end of the day, and the look on the inside looks very expensive...what is not to love about these? I'm not really sure why some people seem more skeptical of these tennis shoes than others, given their price, which seems a bit strange now that they are on the rise and prices just rise so quickly. (I have a few other tennis shoes and they are far more expensive so I'm not going to put any words into a word. The first pair of them cost over $70 and had the same price, and they fit great!!!)<|endoftext|>\n","<|startoftext|>~`5-0~^comfortable~@These fit exactly as as as as socks. They are very comfortable.

However, I'm not sure this top would be comfortable, so I would take the top down.<|endoftext|>\n","<|startoftext|>~`5-0~^~@This top is great. Nice for everyday wear, a little on the pricey side. I wear as a small and it fit perfect. I have large inseam and have been buying one size larger for many months.

The waist fits great under my dress but they aren't the cutest, so that may be my fault (in part because i bought them at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion). The only reason I gave it four stars is the size of the pockets is not as important as the sizing. They don't have a lot of space but are a good size small for me. They don't have much space inside and I don't have many spots to check my name at the door/money purse in the back. I can use a small pocket if the pocket sizes are right but for this price i wanted something more functional. Maybe next time i will order an all black for the extra pockets.

A lot more money for this kind of style if you buy at the mall. I bought 4 pairs. I wish they all have 6 pairs at a lot lower price as there is not what is in this box as you can buy a 6 pair in a store on sale and get 4 pairs of shoes for about the same price.

The leather is soft leather, but the size is very tight. The leather is almost \"sexy.\" At least it's leather, for the price. There are no real reviews on how well the leather feels. I had many comments from others where they said it was soft leather. I'm giving it three stars because the leather is cheap, and I'd never wear it for more than a couple of hours. The leather was nice, and the quality is what I expected. I have to be a bit careful, on these boots, because the leather feels like it's slized from the buckle. My only bad with them is they started falling apart pretty quickly. One pair still broke when I put them on the side. This means there could be more than one fall. The second one also started to turn blue and starting to turn a little lighter (but then as fast as I wear them). I've worn all my shoes in these for about an hour and probably have my feet never been as happy with them as I was with the first pair. My second boots had to be removed from the boots immediately, and I've never had to replace the leather. If I could find another pair of shoes that didn't have the \"sexy\" color, I'd give these three stars!<|endoftext|>\n","<|startoftext|>~`5-0~^love size~@Love It!
