    "With all the strength of the baseline GPT-2 model, the most state of the art model is far too large and inaccessible to implement and re-train to the particular specifications of a new task. In order to create reviews that work particularly well with respect to generating a particular sentiment, we decided to take the next step and build on GPT-2 using Uber's [PPLM algorithm](https://eng.uber.com/pplm/). \n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the previous blog post, PPLM, short for Plug and Play Language Model, is a model developed to steer and control successful language models to complete more specified tasks, such as discussing a particular topic or containing a specific sentiment (positive or negative). For example, while GPT-2 is fantastic at encoding information about speech patterns, grammar, and spelling, we would be unable to force GPT-2 to generate a positive sentence given a negative starting text, such as \"the food is awful\". Instead, PPLM is able to build on top of GPT-2 in order to create a positive conclusion to a negative sentence, such as: \n",
    "*\"The food is awful, but there is also the music, the story and the magic!\n",
    "The “Avenged Sevenfold” is a masterfully performed rock musical that\n",
    "will have a strong presence all over the world.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "PPLM allows us to have flexibility in choosing simple attribute models that represent what we want to control, and plug it into a large, unconditional language model. What makes PPLM so special is that there is no training or fine-tuning required of the large language model — this allows users to utilize the top of the line language models available, even if they do not have the resources to required to train them. The largest and most successful publicly available language models contain up to a billion parameters, take unfathomable amounts of money and resources to train, and often do not provide the training data publicly. On the other hand, these plug-in attribute models may be many orders of magnitude smaller in size. Uber uses the metaphor that these huge language models are like a wooly mammoth that lumbers around aimlessly, and the plug-in attribute model acts as a tiny mouse that sits on the mammoth and guides it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our project of Amazon text review generation, we specifically implemented PPLM-Discrim, where the plug in attribute model on top of GPT-2 is a single layer discriminator with the sole purpose of discriminating between positive and negative sentiments. In other words, this discriminator layer takes the mean of the embedded representation output from the original GPT-2 model and predicts the final output label of rating. In this particular scenario, that is encoded by the ratings associated with the reviews, ranging from most negative at 1, and most positive at 5. "

    "In order to stay consistent with our GPT-2 model, we trained our PPLM discriminator on the same subset of Amazon review data. Specifically we utilized a \"Clothing, Shoes and Jewelry\" dataset, originally containing over 9 million data points with corresponding reviews and texts. Due to the large size of the set, we chose to take a subsample of these 9 million data points, and instead train our discriminator on 10% of the data. We did this to lower the amount of training time from 60 hours to 6 hours. It is worth noting that the original data had relatively imbalanced classes, with much more positive ratings (4's and 5's) than negative ratings (1's and 2's). Our randomly sampled subsample of data had the following class imbalance, where 62% of data points had a 5 rating, 18% had a 4 rating, and the rest of the ratings combined for about 19% of the data. What we see later from the results is that despite the class imbalance, we're still largely able to produce reviews with effective sentiments for both the positive and negative sentiment ratings. \n",

    "\n",
    "Given relatively limited resources in both time and money, we decided to utilize Google Cloud Platform's AI Hub Notebooks service, and we had to determine the best virtual machine set up to maximize our training efficiency and time. After running into multiple memory issues, we decided to settle on using `16 vCPUs, 104 GB RAM` machine type, with a single `NVIDIA Tesla T4` GPU. Furthermore, we used a variety of methods to ensure our code was utilizing the GPU, including running `torch.cuda` device commands to verify GPU installation and availability, running `nvidia-smi` to clarify GPU usage, and finally running `nvidia-smi dmon` to evaluate GPU memory usage efficiency while training. Our final successful training of the PPLM discriminator on our Amazon review data had the following training loss history, where we see a sharp initial decrease in loss, and then a more gradual decrease as all the data is run through.\n",

    "After training, we could now use the PPLM source code to run an example based on the pretrained GPT-2 model and our trained sentiment rating discriminator. Below is an example of the code that we run to generate the review text. In terms of hyperparameter tuning, there were two that we had to adjust in order to produce the desired results. Firstly, the parameter `stepsize` is used to specify topic control. The higher we increase `stepsize`, the more topic control is intensified, whereas the lower it is, the softer the topic control. Secondly, we input parameter `class_label` in order to specify which sentiment we want for our review text output, corresponding to the \"rating\" label from the data. \n",

    "\n",
    "From multiple different trials with a variety of starting sentence tokens, we were excited to find that we would consistently see clearly negative sentiment associated with class labels of 1, and see clearly positive sentiment associated with class labels of 5. We did notice that our PPLM-Discrim model did have an easier to producing accurate class 5 reviews, but sometimes would produce more positive reviews even for lower rated classes. This likely is because of the class imbalance of the data. This could be solved by taking a stratified sample of the data so that all classes are equally represented in the training data. Looking at example of class label 3 text was interesting, because it is relatively hard for humans to specify exactly what \"neutral\" text is. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Rating 3 Texts Gave Interesting Neutral Results \n",
    "A lot of class 3 text came out to be neutral in the sense that the text discussed things like inherent properties or details of the subject, like the size specifications of a piece of clothing, or it discussed the scientific compositions and names of the chemicals related to the subject.

    "### Controlling Sentiment\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we can confirm that we have a higher capability of controlling the sentiment outcome of the sentence, even if we provide the model with a start of sentence with the opposite sentiment. For example, for the input:\n",
    "\n",
    "`= Prefix of sentence =\n",
    "<|endoftext|>This dress is tight`\n",

    "We get the review text output corresponding to a rating label of 5: \n",
    "\n",
    "`= Perturbed generated text =\n",
    "<|endoftext|>This dress is tight, but flattering and cozy, and flattering. This dress is perfect for weddings or other events that require a little attention to detail.`\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, we can give the model a positive sentiment start of sentence and ask for a rating label of 1 text. For the input:\n",
    "\n",
    "`= Prefix of sentence =\n",
    "<|endoftext|>The shirt is nice`\n",
    "\n",
    "We get the review text output:\n",
    "\n",
    "`= Perturbed generated text =\n",
    "<|endoftext|>The shirt is nice, but it does not have a collar or a small picture of the logo on the back. I am not sure what is on the back. It looks too expensive shirt and the sleeves are too thin but my boyfriend and the mother who owns it looks awesome.`\n",
    "\n",
    "### PPLM Outlook\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the PPLM-Discrim algorithm to build on top of our pretrained GPT-2 model, we were able to successfully add an extra layer of complexity through the sentiment discrimantor that allowed us to have greater control over the sentiment of our generated Amazon reviews. Although the results that we displayed in this blog post were convincing, further exploration with a variety of parameters and starting sentences shows that much can be improved in our trained model. Our PPLM model still struggles once in a while with producing coherent text that could be passed off as human text, and in particular it falls relatively short in generating obviously negative reviews as compared to positive reviews. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to improve on what we've been able to do in this short time, we can throw larger resources to train our discrimator, given that we are only using a small fraction of a specific subset of Amazon reviews (only about 900,000 review text data points). There are plenty of other datasets that we could combine to cover a much larger variety of human speech patterns, and this can be achieved by simply putting more time into our training and using a larger dataset. On the other hand, the key to improving our PPLM model's outputs of negative sentiment reviews is to ensure the class balance in the training data provides the discriminator enough to accurately represente negative sentiment texts. This can be achieved by injecting more lower rating reviews into our dataset, or performing some sort of stratified sampling in the data to ensure equal class balancing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we have now been able to generate text reviews based on a keyword topic, and based on a particular sentiment. The next step is to try and combine these two, so that we can provide our review generation model both a general subject/keyword and a sentiment, and have it produce a convincing review that falls in both categories. We attempt to do this using Salesforce's CTRL algorithm. "
